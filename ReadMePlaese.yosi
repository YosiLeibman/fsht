After page refresh, you'll get a double notification.
This is because I left the React's strict mode on, so it runs twice on dev mode.
On prod mode, it runs once. I could remove strict mode to fix it but preferred
to stay with it to catch errors and better code writing.

I hope this time I met all your expectations and understand all the requirements.

Thanks for reviewing!
